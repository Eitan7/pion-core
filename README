Build and installation summary:

# make all
# [su root]
# make install

See INSTALL or run "./configure --help" for more detailed instructions.

libpion REQUIRES the Boost C++ libraries (version 1.33 or greater),
including the Boost ASIO library.  Boost ASIO has been accepted into Boost
but is not yet included in the distribution.  Boost ASIO additionally
requires OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support and zlib for compression.  To enable
logging support, libpion must also be built with the Apache log4cxx library.
You can download these libraries from the following locations:

http://www.boost.org
http://asio.sourceforge.net
http://www.openssl.org
http://www.zlib.net
http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
