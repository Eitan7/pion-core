of the platforms supported by Pion within the "common/doc" subdirectory
(README.platform).  Please read these instructions first.

Build and installation summary:

# ./configure [--with-openssl] [--with-log4cxx]
# make all
# make check	(this will build and run Pion's unit tests)
# make install	(this may require superuser/Administrator privileges)

For logging, Pion may be configured to:

a) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (the default configuration)
b) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively)
c) disable logging entirely (configure --disable-logging)
