libpion REQUIRES the Boost C++ libraries (version 1.33.1 or greater),
including the Boost ASIO library.  Boost ASIO has been accepted into Boost
but is not yet included in the distribution.  Boost ASIO additionally
requires OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support and zlib for compression.  You can
download these libraries from the following locations:

http://www.boost.org
http://asio.sourceforge.net
http://www.openssl.org
http://www.zlib.net

For logging, libpion may be configured to:

a) disable logging entirely (the default configuration)
b) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (configure --with-ostream-logging)
c) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively)

You can download these logging libraries from the following locations:

http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net
http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net
