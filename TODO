Things to do:
=============

* Use read-write mutex for HTTPServer modules
* Compare performance of using multiple io_services versus just one
* Allow more options for binding servers than just port numbers (IP)
* Add support for Sun Studio & Microsoft Visual C++ compilers
* Add support for parsing multipart form content?
* Add support for built-in authentication (OpenID)?
* Switch to Jam or CMake build system instead of autotools?
* Is the Windows shutdown crash really caused by bad DLL code?
