Running piond:
--------------

Make sure "C:\Boost\Lib" is on your path.

If you got the source code from the Subversion repository and haven't yet run
Doxygen, then run Doxygen from <PION_NET_HOME>\docs.  (The documentation is
used as part of the test.)

To test piond, run it from the project directory with the following command line args: 

	-c ..\tests\vcpiond.conf

To run from within the IDE, go to piond Property Pages -> Debugging,
and set 'Command Arguments' to the above.
