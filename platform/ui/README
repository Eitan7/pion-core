The folder dojo-release contains a Dojo custom build of the Pion UI, which contains
all the Pion UI code, plus all the Dojo source code that it needs, baked into two
main files (dojo/dojo.js and dojo/pion-dojo.js) and an almost minimal set of 
supporting files.  The advantage of this is that startup is much faster because 
only a handful of files need to be loaded.  However, if you want to edit or debug
the Pion UI source code (in ui/scripts, ui/plugins and ui/resources), you will need 
your own copy of Dojo: download 
http://download.dojotoolkit.org/current-dev/dojo-release-1.1.0-src.zip
and extract it into C:.  Then follow the directions in index.html about how to use
the source code instead of the built code, and uncomment the block in services.xml
defining dojo-src-service.

If you make changes and want to do a new Dojo custom build, see 
dojo-custom-build/README.
